Unit test cases- Will focus on individual components, ensuring they function correctly in isolation. For instance, we will test character movement, obstacle generation, or score calculation independently to verify their accuracy. This approach helps catch bugs early and facilitates easier debugging, contributing to the overall stability of the game.
Sample input data- When sampling input data for testing mobile games, we will consider a range of scenarios and edge cases. Include various character positions, obstacle configurations, and input combinations to simulate different gameplay situations. Additionally, cover boundary cases, such as the maximum and minimum values for variables like score or character speed. This diverse input sampling helps ensure that the unit tests cover a broad spectrum of potential scenarios, improving the robustness of your testing strategy.

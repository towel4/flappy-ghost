To simplify the code review and debugging advice for your Flappy Bird-like game's restart functionality, let's focus on the essential aspects:

1. **Check Component Connections**: Ensure your `gameOverLabel`, `restartButton`, `flappyBird`, `pipeTop`, `pipeBottom`, and `gameTimer` are correctly linked to the UI components in your form. This linkage is crucial for the code to interact with your game's UI elements.

2. **Variable Accessibility**: Verify that variables such as `score` and `scoreLabel` are declared in a scope accessible by the `EndGame` and `RestartButton_Click` methods. These variables need to be properly declared and initialized to store game data.

3. **Event Handler Setup**: Make sure the `RestartButton_Click` method is connected to the restart button's click event. This connection is necessary for the restart logic to execute when the button is clicked. In Windows Forms, this typically looks like adding `restartButton.Click += RestartButton_Click;` in your form's constructor or through the designer.

4. **Correct Names and Types**: Double-check that the names used in the code (`gameOverLabel`, `restartButton`, etc.) match the names given to the components in the form designer. Also, ensure that `restartButton` is a type that supports the `Visible` and `Enabled` properties, like a Button.

5. **Simple Error Handling**: While the provided code is straightforward, adding basic error handling can prevent unexpected crashes. For instance, you can check if components are null before accessing their properties.

6. **Game State Reset**: In the `RestartButton_Click` method, resetting the game state (score, positions of the bird and pipes) is crucial. Ensure this resetting does not interfere with any ongoing game logic that may not be halted.

By focusing on these simplified points, you should be able to effectively review and debug the restart functionality of your game. If there's a specific issue you're encountering, providing details about the problem can help in offering more targeted advice.

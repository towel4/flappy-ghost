# Flappy Ghost ISP
The inspiration for this project stemmed from a childhood favorite game called Flappy Bird. There will be a character flying while dodging obstacles along the way using the space key or tapping the screen.
# Vision Statement
The vision document for "Flappy Ghost" outlines the development of a 2D game where a player, embodied as a ghost, navigates in the air through obstacles to achieve the farthest distance possible. Inspired by "Flappy Bird," the product perspective for "Flappy Ghost" involves creating a game that aims to provide a challenging and rewarding adventure for players, based on the assumption that the game will effectively capture the essence of an ‘endless’ player. The constraints for "Flappy Ghost" include potential scheduling conflicts among developers, the need to work with complex game aspects, challenging testing and debugging due to potential runtime states, and technical hurdles related to limited experience with Unity and the C# programming language, posing a steep learning curve for the team. The documentation requirements for the game include the development of a user manual to provide thorough direction for players and an installation guide, configuration, and Read Me file to ensure easy installation and setup for an enhanced user experience.
